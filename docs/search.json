    "text": "Long–Short Trend Strategy\n\n1. Portfolio Universe\nWe selected these 10 stocks for their strong sector representation, high liquidity, and market relevance. Each stock comes from a different major industry, ensuring diversification and reducing sector-specific risk. As large-cap, actively traded companies, they offer reliable data and efficient execution,.\n\nAAPL – Information Electronics\nMSFT – Information Technology\nJPM – Financial\nXOM – Energy\nJNJ – Healthcare\nPG – Consumer Staples\nNVDA – Semiconductors\nCAT – Industrial\nHD – Retail\nAMZN – Communication Services\n\n\n\n2. Rebalancing Frequency\nThe portfolio is rebalanced monthly. At each rebalancing period, the latest technical data is used to recalculate indicator scores and update the portfolio positions.\n\n\n3. Technical Indicator Scoring System\nEach stock is scored (0–5 per indicator) for both long and short setups based on:\n\n3.1 EMA Deviation (Delta) Calculation\nThe EMA deviation measures how far the current price is from its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It is calculated as:\nΔ = 100% * (Close - EMA_20) / EMA_20\n\nLong Scores (price above EMA):\n\nΔ &gt; +5%: 5 points\nΔ between +3% and +5%: 4 points\nΔ between +1% and +3%: 3 points\nΔ between 0% and +1%: 2 points\nOtherwise: 0 points\n\nShort Scores (price below EMA):\n\nΔ &lt; –5%: 5 points\nΔ between –5% and –3%: 4 points\nΔ between –3% and –1%: 3 points\nΔ between –1% and 0%: 2 points\nOtherwise: 0 points\n\n\n\n\n3.2 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\n\nCalculation: MACD difference = (MACD line – Signal line)\nLong Scores:\n\nMACD_diff ≥ +1.5: 5 points\nMACD_diff in [1.0, 1.5): 4 points\nMACD_diff in [0.5, 1.0): 3 points\nMACD_diff in [0.1, 0.5): 2 points\nOtherwise: 0 points\n\nShort Scores:\n\nMACD_diff ≤ –1.5: 5 points\nMACD_diff in (–1.5, –1.0]: 4 points\nMACD_diff in (–1.0, –0.5]: 3 points\nMACD_diff in (–0.5, –0.1]: 2 points\nOtherwise: 0 points\n\n\n\n\n3.3 ADX (Average Directional Index)\n\nCommon for both directions:\n\nADX ≥ 40: 5 points\nADX between 30 and 40: 4 points\nADX between 25 and 30: 3 points\nADX between 20 and 25: 2 points\nADX &lt; 20: 0 points\n\n\n\n\n3.4 ATR (Average True Range)\n\nCalculation: Use the ratio of the current ATR to the 20-day ATR average.\nCommon for both directions:\n\nATR Ratio between 0.8 and 1.2: 5 points\nATR Ratio between 0.6–0.8 or 1.2–1.5: 4 points\nATR Ratio between 0.4–0.6 or 1.5–1.8: 3 points\nATR Ratio between 0.2–0.4 or 1.8–2.0: 2 points\nATR Ratio &lt; 0.2 or &gt; 2.0: 0 points\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Determining Trade Direction & Weight Allocation\nFor each stock:  Total_Long = EMA_long + MACD_long + ADX_score + ATR_score Total_Short = EMA_short + MACD_short + ADX_score + ATR_score\nThe direction is chosen by comparing the two totals. The absolute total score is then normalized among stocks in that category (long or short) to determine the weight. Long positions have positive weights while short positions have negative weights.\n\n\n5. Risk Management Rules\n\nIndividual stock weight is capped at 20% (absolute value).\nOverall short exposure is limited to 40% of the portfolio.\nStop-Loss: Exit a position if it falls more than 10% from the entry price.\nTake-Profit: Close a position if it gains more than 20% from the entry price."
